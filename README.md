# Assignment Express routing

about middleware libraries:

I think there's a lot of nice libraries, but none of them really "took my breath away"
most of the time, I would have a sense to look for a library like this
and we also worker with a few of them in the class
I suppose I would be using
      - body-parser, cookie-parser
      - serve-static, session, 
      - express debug? 
      - passport
